This discovery allowed for Spain, and the other European countries shortly thereafter, to exploit indigenous peoples for labor. In addition, American goods could be exported to Europe in the Columbian Exchange. Columbus's discovery of the New World marked a turning point in European history as the wealth of countries quickly swelled from the riches to be found in the Americas.`

They were often used by families with unbaptized babies that would otherwise end up in limbo. They cleansed the people that they were used on of (original) sin. Martin Luther, a German theologian, detested the sale of indulgences because it was an example of corruption in the Catholic Church.'

The <em>Ninety-five Theses</em> outlined Luther's argument against the sale of indulgences. This October day is often considered the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, in which new religions such as Lutheranism and Calvinism split from Catholicism. The Protestant Reformation fundamentally changed the religious makeup of Europe, and it created a scapegoat for political wars in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.`
